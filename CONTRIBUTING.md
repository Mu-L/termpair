# Contributing guidelines

We're glad to see you here! This short document should give you some hints to get started with contributing to TermPair.

## Getting started

First, fork the repo and clone it to your computer, then read the section you're interested in. üëç

### Contributing Python code

Install [nox](https://pypi.org/project/nox/), then run the server with:

```
nox -s serve
```

After the server is running, you can share your terminal to it:
```
nox -s broadcast
```
Then type `exit` to stop broadcasting.


### Contributing frontend code

To modify frontend code, get [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and run:

```
make install_frontend
```

to install dependencies.

You'll then be able to build the frontend app using:

```bash
make build_frontend
```

The TermPair server does not need to be reloaded, so you can just refresh the webpage to view changes.

Alternatively, changes that don't require an actively connected terminal can be tested much more easily with hot reloading by running:

```bash
make watch_frontend
```

### Contributing documentation

TermPair's documentation is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and the [MkDocs Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and is in the `docs/` directory.

To view documentation locally, run:

```bash
nox -s watch_docs
```

## Proposing changes

If you've found a bug, have a feature request, or would like to contribute documentation, here's what you can do to have your change merged in:

1. (Recommended) If the problem is non-trivial, you should [open an issue][issue] to discuss it with maintainers.
2. Work on a separate branch, and make sure tests pass before pushing them to the remote.
3. [Open a pull request][pr] with your changes.
